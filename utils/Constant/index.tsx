    <strong> Search engine optimization: </strong> Search engine optimization (SEO) is a method for improving the chances for a website to be found by
    search engines. Web design codes information in a way that search engines can read it. It can boost business because the site shows up on the top
    search result pages, helping people to find it.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong> Mobile responsiveness:</strong> Mobile responsiveness is the feature of a website that allows it to display on a mobile device and adapt
    its layout and proportions to be legible. Web design ensures sites are easy to view and navigate from mobile devices. When a website is
    well-designed and mobile-responsive, customers can reach the business with ease.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong> Improved sales:</strong>Increasing the number of items sold or acquiring more active customers are objectives of a compelling website. As
    web design reaches targeted customers and search engines, it helps the business make conversions on their site and improve its sales.

Knowledge of facts, also called propositional knowledge, is often defined as true belief that is distinct from opinion or guesswork by virtue of justification.

Many theorists also include introspection as a source of knowledge, not of external physical objects, but of ones own mental states. Other sources often discussed include memory, rational intuition, inference, and testimony. According to foundationalism, some of these sources are basic in the sense that they can justify beliefs without depending on other mental states. This claim is rejected by coherentists.`;
