Due to its popularity, plenty of tutorials and online forums are available to help you get started."}<br />{"One of the reasons why Bootstrap is so popular among web developers and web designers is that it has a simple file structure. Its files are compiled for easy access, and it only requires basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS to modify them."}<br />{"You can also use themes for popular content management systems as learning tools. For example, most WordPress themes were developed using Bootstrap, which any beginner web developer can access. "}<br />{"To increase the site's page load time, Bootstrap minifies the CSS and JavaScript files. Additionally, Bootstrap maintains consistency across the syntax between websites and developers, which is ideal for team-based projects."}</p>

This will benefit your websiteâ€™s performance, as reducing image sizes ispart of the site optimization process."}<br />{"Bootstrap also provides additional classes likeimg-circle and .img-rounded, which help to modify the images' shape."}</p>
